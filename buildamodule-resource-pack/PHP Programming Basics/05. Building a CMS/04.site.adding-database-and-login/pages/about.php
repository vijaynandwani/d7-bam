  <p>Hi, my name is Michael Brown-Schtick, and I'm the founder of AmaZING! When my daughter was little, she wasn't very good at playing fetch - a common problem with modern children. After a long period of trial and error, I realized that the problem wasn't with the child, it was with the stick!</p>
  <p>Most sticks make a slight wooshing sound as they are thrown, which is not enough to interest most toddlers. So for months I worked in my basement, trying to find just the right shape that would cause a distinctive noise throughout the entire arc, without adding so much wind resistance that it would sacrifice on distance.</p>
  <p>Finally I emerged with a now patented design, and from the basement we have moved to an 8000 foot warehouse and stick-producing factory. Parents and toddlers all over the world are rejoicing, but they're not the only ones.</p>
  <p>Our sticks are being used in over 1000 unique ways across the world. Digging up worms, blocking the sun on bright days, and signaling to jet skis when swimming are just a few of the unique ways our sticks have been used.</p>
  <p>We're happy to have you here, please let us know what we can do to earn your business and improve your world with beautiful, hand-crafted sticks.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br />Michael Brown-Schtick</p>
